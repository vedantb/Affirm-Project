## To run tests

`yarn test`

## Additional Comments

Built on top a simple Create React App setup. Utilized the `enzyme` package for testing.
The react app is divided into 2 simple components:

1. The Card Form - the outer skeleton which renders multiple input fields and handles validation of the input fields
2. The Input Field - a generic input field component which displays an input field and its errors

Things to improve:

1. More tests related to how validation and error states for individual fields and the 2 card types are handled
2. Improving accessibility
